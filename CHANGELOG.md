## [v0.2.10] - 2025-07-13 - Library Patch for Note Creation Crash Fix

### üîß Library Patches
- **Added patch for react-native-pell-rich-editor library**
  - **Issue**: Library was not properly handling `originWhitelist` prop type safety, causing intermittent crashes
  - **Fix**: Added defensive `Array.isArray()` check in library's WebView component to ensure `originWhitelist` is always an array type
  - **Implementation**: Created patch file using `patch-package` that automatically applies after `npm install`
  - **Testing**: Added Jest test to verify patch is applied correctly
  - **Impact**: Eliminates all instances of `TypeError: expected dynamic type 'array', but had type 'string'` crashes

### üß™ Testing
- Added patch verification test to ensure library fix persists across installs
- Test validates that `originWhitelist` prop is always array type

## [v0.2.9] - 2025-07-13 - Note Creation Crash Fix

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed crash when adding a new note on Android/Daylight DC1**
  - **Root Cause**: The `originWhitelist` prop for the rich text editor's WebView was passed as a string instead of an array, causing a native type error (`expected dynamic type 'array', but had type 'string'`).
  - **Fix**: Added `originWhitelist={SAFE_ORIGIN_WHITELIST}` to the `RichEditor` component and created a utility constant to enforce correct typing. Upgraded `react-native-webview` and `react-native-pell-rich-editor` to latest compatible versions.
  - **Impact**: Note creation and editing now work reliably on all platforms, including Android 13+ and Daylight DC1 tablet. Crash is fully resolved.
