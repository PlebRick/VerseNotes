# Milestone 1: Project Initialization & API Migration
_Date: 2025-07-06_

## Summary
- Initialized the VerseNotes React Native project with Expo, TypeScript, and a modular architecture. Migrated Bible API integration from api.bible (with API keys and CORS/auth issues) to bible-api.com (public, no-auth, WEB only). Updated all code and documentation to reflect the new architecture and data model.

## Context
- The project began as a port of the Base44 web-based Bible study app, targeting Android 13 and the Daylight DC1 tablet. The initial goal was to create a robust, offline-friendly, note-taking Bible app with a modern UI and local data persistence. Early attempts used api.bible, but CORS and authentication issues prompted a migration to bible-api.com.

## Changes Made
- Created project structure with Expo, TypeScript, and Base44-inspired folders (`src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/entities/`, etc.).
- Implemented core components: `BibleStudy.tsx`, `BibleColumn.tsx`, `NotesColumn.tsx`, `NoteEditor.tsx`, `BibleSearchBar.tsx`, and `Settings.tsx`.
- Integrated bible-api.com (WEB only, no API key required) for all scripture lookups. Removed all code and docs related to API keys, Bible IDs, and multiple translations.
- Updated data models: introduced `FormattedPassage` and `Verse` types to match bible-api.com's response.
- Updated and synced all documentation: `README.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `goals.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_RESULTS.md`.
- Created `development/` directory for milestone documentation.

## Rationale
- The migration to bible-api.com was necessary to avoid CORS/auth issues and simplify the user experience (no API keys, public WEB translation). The new data model and code cleanup ensure maintainability and clarity for future development.

## Implementation Details
- Used Expo managed workflow for rapid development and Android compatibility.
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- AsyncStorage for local note persistence.
- Responsive 2-column layout for tablet, modal note editor for mobile.
- All major files and features are documented in `README.md` and `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
- See commits: 368258d (docs & migration), 7c742fb (Expo init), 0a31054, e0c51b2, 0fc4be4 (feature/fix commits).

## Testing & Validation
- Manual QA: Verified Bible passage search (e.g., "John 3:16", "Romans 1:1-16") loads and displays correctly.
- Verified all components render without errors.
- Confirmed no TypeScript compilation errors.
- Checked AsyncStorage persistence works correctly.

## Code Cleanup (Post v0.2.0-ux)
_Date: 2025-01-20_

### Issues Identified & Resolved
1. **Dead Code**: Removed unused `AppContent` component and `useThemeContext` import from `App.tsx`
2. **Type Safety**: Fixed `any` type warnings:
   - Added `RawVerseData` interface for bible-api.com response in `BiblePassage.ts`
   - Changed `handleSettingChange` parameter type from `any` to `string | boolean` in `Settings.tsx`
3. **Dependency Version**: Downgraded TypeScript from 5.8.3 to 5.5.4 to match ESLint's supported version range
4. **Code Quality**: Fixed all ESLint issues:
   - Added missing React import for JSX
   - Removed unused imports (`StatusBar`, `View`, `StyleSheet`)
   - Properly typed Stack.Navigator with `RootStackParamList`
   - Removed unused `styles` variable

### Results
- ✅ **ESLint**: Zero errors, zero warnings
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Compilation passes without errors
- ✅ **App Functionality**: Starts successfully, Metro Bundler loads correctly
- ✅ **Code Quality**: All dead code removed, proper TypeScript types throughout

### Technical Details
- Used `edit_file` and `search_replace` tools for precise code modifications
- Ran comprehensive linting with `--max-warnings=0` to catch all issues
- Verified TypeScript compilation with `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Tested app startup with `npx expo start --web` to ensure no functionality was broken
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving code quality and maintainability

## Platform Compatibility & Note Synchronization Fixes
_Date: 2025-01-20_

### Issues Identified & Resolved
1. **Theme Switching**: Fixed theme preferences not updating UI in real-time
   - Problem: `ThemeProvider` and `Settings` used separate `useColorScheme()` instances
   - Solution: Created `useColorSchemeFromContext()` for shared state management
   - Added `React.useMemo` for proper dependency tracking in ThemeProvider

2. **Note Editor Web Compatibility**: Fixed rich text editor failing on web platform
   - Problem: `react-native-pell-rich-editor` uses WebView which doesn't work on web
   - Solution: Added platform-specific conditional rendering (TextInput for web, RichEditor for mobile)
   - Fixed Save/Cancel buttons with web-compatible alert functions

3. **Note Synchronization**: Fixed saved notes not appearing in Bible passage sections
   - Problem: `verseReference` passed as empty string when no verses selected
   - Root Cause: `verseReference={selectedVerses.length > 0 ? passage?.reference : undefined}`
   - Solution: Always pass current passage reference: `verseReference={passage?.reference}`

4. **State Timing Issues**: Fixed race conditions between Bible passage loading and note filtering
   - Problem: Notes wouldn't appear after searching, requiring manual refresh
   - Root Cause: Existing notes had empty `verse_reference` values
   - Solution: Implemented smart filtering algorithm that matches notes by title fallback

5. **Passage Persistence**: Added localStorage persistence for better Bible study UX
   - Problem: Page refresh cleared Bible passage but kept notes (inconsistent UX)
   - Solution: Auto-save/restore last searched passage with localStorage
   - Feature: Search input also restores, providing seamless study session continuity

### Results
- ✅ **Theme Switching**: Light/Dark/System themes work instantly on all platforms
- ✅ **Note Editor**: Works on both web (TextInput) and mobile (RichEditor) platforms
- ✅ **Note Synchronization**: Notes appear immediately in correct Bible passage sections
- ✅ **Smart Filtering**: Handles legacy notes and different reference formats seamlessly
- ✅ **Persistence**: Page refresh maintains Bible study context (passage + notes)
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Consistent functionality across web and mobile
- ✅ **User Experience**: Seamless note creation, theme switching, and study session continuity

### Technical Details
- Added web-compatible alert system using `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()`
- Implemented platform detection with `Platform.OS === 'web'` conditional rendering
- Fixed context state sharing with proper React hooks and memoization
- Created smart note filtering with title-based fallback matching
- Added localStorage persistence with AsyncStorage for passage state
- Verified comprehensive end-to-end functionality with real user testing
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding web platform support

## Next Steps
- Enhance book name mapping for flexible search.
- Add offline passage caching.
- Implement cloud sync for notes.
- Expand test coverage and CI/CD integration.
- Document future milestones in new files: `development/02_*.md`, etc.

## Milestone Updates
- **Milestone 2**: Notes Enhancement - See `development/02_notes_enhancement.md`
- **Milestone 3**: UI Theming & Dark Mode - See `development/03_ui_theming.md`
- **Milestone 4**: Base44 UI Implementation - See `development/04_base44_ui_implementation.md`
