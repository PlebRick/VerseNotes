# Milestone 1.5: Repository Cleanup & API Migration Cleanup
_Date: 2025-07-06_

## Summary
- Completed comprehensive repository cleanup to remove all outdated files and references related to the previous API migration. Eliminated obsolete test files, outdated documentation, and cleaned up code references to ensure the codebase is consistent with the current bible-api.com implementation.

## Context
- Following the API migration from api.bible/Crossway ESV API to bible-api.com in Milestone 1, several outdated files and code references remained in the repository. These files were causing confusion and contained references to API keys and endpoints that are no longer used. A systematic cleanup was needed to ensure the codebase is clean and consistent.

## Changes Made
- **Deleted 6 obsolete files**:
  - `API_SETUP.md` - Crossway ESV API setup documentation
  - `debug-api.js` - api.bible debugging script
  - `test-api.js` - api.bible testing script
  - `test-crossway-api.js` - Crossway ESV API testing script
  - `test-app-integration.js` - Crossway ESV integration testing
  - `startApp.md` - Outdated startup instructions with API key references

- **Updated 3 files with outdated references**:
  - `src/entities/BiblePassage.ts` - Removed api.bible endpoints, added placeholder methods for future API integration
  - `src/components/bible/BibleSearchBar.tsx` - Updated comment to reference bible-api.com instead of api.bible
  - `app.config.js` - Removed BIBLE_API_KEY reference, added bible-api.com URL configuration

## Rationale
- The cleanup was necessary to eliminate confusion and ensure consistency across the codebase. Outdated files could mislead developers into thinking API keys are still required or that the old API endpoints are still functional. The cleanup ensures that all documentation and code references accurately reflect the current bible-api.com implementation.

## Implementation Details
- **File Deletion**: Removed all test scripts and documentation related to api.bible and Crossway ESV API
- **Code Updates**: Replaced api.bible endpoints with placeholder methods and updated comments
- **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed API key references from app configuration
- **Documentation Consistency**: Ensured all remaining files accurately reflect current implementation

## Testing & Validation
- **Repository Scan**: Verified no remaining references to api.bible, esv.org, or API keys
- **Code Review**: Confirmed all updated files compile correctly
- **Documentation Review**: Verified all documentation is current and accurate
- **Configuration Check**: Confirmed app.config.js no longer references obsolete API keys

## Next Steps
- Continue with Milestone 2 (Notes Enhancement) development
- Monitor for any remaining outdated references during development
- Maintain clean repository practices for future API integrations
- Document future milestones in new files: `development/02_*.md`, etc.
