# Milestone 2: Notes Enhancement & User Experience Improvements
_Date: 2025-07-06_

## Summary
- Enhanced the note-taking functionality with improved user experience, better data management, and additional features. Focused on making the note-taking process more intuitive and efficient for Bible study workflows.

## Context
- Following the successful API migration and core functionality implementation in Milestone 1, the app now has a solid foundation with Bible text display and basic note-taking capabilities. However, user feedback and testing revealed opportunities to improve the note-taking experience, data organization, and overall usability.

## Changes Made
- Enhanced note editor with rich text formatting capabilities
- Implemented note categorization and tagging system
- Added note search and filtering functionality
- Improved note export options (Markdown, PDF)
- Enhanced note synchronization and backup features
- Added note templates for common study patterns
- Implemented note sharing capabilities
- Improved note organization with folders and collections

## Rationale
- The current note-taking system, while functional, lacks the depth and organization features that serious Bible study requires. Users need better ways to categorize, search, and organize their notes. The enhancement focuses on making the app more suitable for long-term study and research.

## Implementation Details
- Rich text editor using React Native compatible libraries
- Tag system with auto-completion and color coding
- Search functionality with full-text search across notes
- Export system supporting multiple formats
- Template system for common note types (sermon notes, study notes, etc.)
- Folder organization with drag-and-drop support
- Cloud sync preparation for future implementation

## Testing & Validation
- User acceptance testing with Bible study groups
- Performance testing with large note collections
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Export functionality validation
- Search and filtering accuracy testing

## Next Steps
- Implement cloud synchronization for notes
- Add collaborative note sharing features
- Enhance offline capabilities with local caching
- Integrate with external Bible study resources
- Add advanced analytics and study insights
- Document future milestones in new files: `development/03_*.md`, etc.
