# Development Milestone Documentation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and process for maintaining historical context across development milestones in the VerseNotes project. The goal is to ensure that any developer (or AI agent) can quickly understand the project's evolution, context for decisions, and rationale behind major changes—especially after long gaps or team changes.

## Directory Structure

```
development/
├── instructions.md          # This file - strategy and process
├── 01_development.md        # Milestone 1: Project Initialization & API Migration
├── 02_*.md                 # Future milestones (e.g., 02_notes_enhancement.md)
└── README.md               # Optional: Index of all milestones
```

## Milestone Documentation Template

Each milestone file should follow this standard template:

```markdown
# Milestone N: [Short Title]
_Date: YYYY-MM-DD_

## Summary
- Brief description of what was accomplished and why.

## Context
- What was the state of the project before this milestone?
- What problem or goal prompted this work?

## Changes Made
- List of major changes (features, refactors, deletions, migrations).
- Key files added/removed/modified.
- Any breaking changes or migration steps.

## Rationale
- Why were these changes made?
- What alternatives were considered (if any)?

## Implementation Details
- Notable implementation notes, gotchas, or design decisions.
- Code snippets or links to relevant PRs/commits.

## Testing & Validation
- How was this milestone tested?
- Any manual QA steps or automated test results.

## Next Steps
- What's planned for the next milestone?
- Open questions or technical debt to address.

## When to Create a New Milestone

Create a new milestone file when any of the following occurs:

### Major Features
- New core functionality is added
- Significant user-facing features are implemented
- Major UI/UX changes are completed

### Architectural Changes
- Data model changes
- API integrations or migrations
- Framework or library updates
- Performance optimizations

### Refactors
- Large-scale code reorganization
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Migration between technologies
- Dependency updates with breaking changes

### Infrastructure
- CI/CD setup or changes
- Deployment process changes
- Environment configuration updates
- Security-related changes

## Process for Documenting Milestones

### At the End of Each Major Milestone

1. **Scan the Repository**
   - Review git log for recent commits
   - Check for new files, deleted files, or major modifications
   - Review any updated documentation

2. **Fill Out the Template**
   - Use the standard template above
   - Be specific about what changed and why
   - Include relevant commit hashes or PR numbers
   - Document any gotchas or lessons learned

3. **Update Related Documentation**
   - Ensure README.md and other docs reflect current state
   - Update any configuration files or setup instructions
   - Verify that all references are current

### When Starting a New Milestone

1. **Review Previous Milestones**
   - Read the latest milestone file(s) for context
   - Understand the current state and any open issues
   - Note any technical debt or planned improvements

2. **Create New Milestone File**
   - Use the next sequential number (e.g., `02_*.md`)
   - Begin documenting as you work, not just at the end
   - Update the milestone file as you make progress

### During Development

- **Update the milestone file** as you make significant progress
- **Reference the milestone file** in commit messages or PR descriptions
- **Link to commits/PRs** from the milestone file for traceability

## Instructions for AI Agents

When working on this project, AI agents should:

1. **At the Start of Each Session**
   - Review the latest milestone file(s) in `development/`
   - Understand the current project state and recent changes
   - Note any open issues or planned work

2. **During Development**
   - Update the current milestone file as you make significant changes
   - Document any architectural decisions or implementation details
   - Note any issues encountered or solutions found

3. **At the End of Each Session**
   - Complete the milestone documentation if a major feature is finished
   - Update any relevant documentation files
   - Ensure the milestone file accurately reflects the current state

4. **When Starting New Work**
   - Create a new milestone file if starting a new major feature
   - Reference the previous milestone for context
   - Document the goals and approach for the new milestone

## Best Practices

### Documentation Quality
- **Be Specific**: Include file names, commit hashes, and specific changes
- **Explain Why**: Always document the rationale behind decisions
- **Include Context**: What was the problem? What alternatives were considered?
- **Note Gotchas**: Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved

### File Organization
- **Use Descriptive Names**: `02_notes_enhancement.md` not `02_feature.md`
- **Include Dates**: Always include the date in the milestone file
- **Keep Self-Contained**: Each milestone file should be understandable on its own
- **Cross-Reference**: Link to related documentation, commits, or PRs

### Maintenance
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and update milestone documentation
- **Clean Up**: Remove obsolete information or consolidate related milestones
- **Version Control**: Commit milestone files with the related code changes

## Example Workflow

### Starting a New Feature
1. Review `development/01_development.md` for current state
2. Create `development/02_offline_caching.md`
3. Document the goal and approach
4. Begin development, updating the milestone file as you progress

### Completing a Feature
1. Finish the implementation
2. Test and validate the changes
3. Update the milestone file with final details
4. Update related documentation (README.md, etc.)
5. Commit all changes together

### Resuming Work After a Break
1. Read the latest milestone file(s) in `development/`
2. Understand the current state and any open issues
3. Continue with the next planned work
4. Update milestone documentation as you progress

## Integration with Git Workflow

### Commit Messages
- Reference milestone files in commit messages when appropriate
- Use conventional commit format: `feat: add offline caching (see development/02_*.md)`

### Pull Requests
- Include milestone file updates in PRs
- Reference milestone files in PR descriptions
- Link to milestone files for context

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches for major work
- Update milestone files on the feature branch
- Merge milestone documentation with the feature code

## Future Enhancements

Consider these optional improvements to the milestone system:

1. **Milestone Index**: Create `development/README.md` as an index of all milestones
2. **Changelog Integration**: Use `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes, keep `development/` for technical context
3. **Automated Tracking**: Use git hooks or CI/CD to prompt for milestone updates
4. **Visual Timeline**: Create a visual representation of project milestones
5. **Cross-References**: Add links between related milestones

## Conclusion

This milestone documentation strategy ensures that:
- Historical context is preserved across development sessions
- Major decisions and their rationale are documented
- New team members or AI agents can quickly understand the project
- Technical debt and future plans are tracked
- The project maintains a clear development history

By following these instructions consistently, the VerseNotes project will maintain a comprehensive and useful historical record that supports ongoing development and collaboration.
