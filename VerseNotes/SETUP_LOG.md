# VerseNotes Project Setup - Terminal Command Log

This document contains the complete terminal command log for setting up the VerseNotes React Native project.

## Project Initialization

```bash
# 1. Create new Expo project with TypeScript template
npx create-expo-app@latest VerseNotes --template blank-typescript

# 2. Navigate to project directory and install required dependencies
cd VerseNotes
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-vector-icons react-native-drawer-layout-polyfill @expo/vector-icons

## Project Structure Creation

```bash
# 3. Create directory structure mirroring Base44 pattern
mkdir -p src/components src/pages src/entities src/utils src/types

# Directory structure created:
# src/
# ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
# ├── pages/          # Screen components
# ├── entities/       # Data models and business logic
# ├── utils/          # Utility functions and API clients
# └── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
```

## React Native CLI Setup

## React Native Doctor Check

```bash
# 6. Initial doctor check (showed dependency issue)
npx react-native doctor

# Output:
# ⚠️ react-native depends on @react-native-community/cli for cli commands. To fix 
# update your package.json to include:
# "devDependencies": {
#   "@react-native-community/cli": "latest",
# }
```

## Expo Dependency Fix

```bash
# 7. Fix Expo dependencies for compatibility
npx expo install --fix

# Output:
# The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
# @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.2.0 - expected version: 2.1.2
# Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
